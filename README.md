- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Juan.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently developing a personal project about an e-commerce to make group orders to local farmers. I'm building this fullstack web app with typescript ecosystem (nextjs, react, trpc (react-query), zod, prisma (ORM), mysql (planetscale), tailwindcss, nextauth, vercel, etc). Using the [T3Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) ðŸ™Œ. 

- ðŸ‘€ You can check my dotfiles that I'm using on my Arch Linux distro.
